CONTIG: Consensus_SC2188.consensus_threshold_0.75_quality_20 (29903bp)
Best alignment score: 29496.3 (LEN: 29517, IDY: 99.93), Total number of alignments: 2
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
		This contig has several significant sets of alignments. [An ambiguously mapped contig]
		Using only the very best set (option --ambiguity-usage is set to "one").
			The best set is below. Score: 29562.3, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 315
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 9 79 | 9 79 | 71 71 | 100.0 | MN908947.3 Consensus_SC2188.consensus_threshold_0.75_quality_20
			  Incorrectly estimated size of scaffold gap between these two alignments: gap length difference = -165 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 320 29836 | 320 29836 | 29517 29517 | 99.93 | MN908947.3 Consensus_SC2188.consensus_threshold_0.75_quality_20
