## Data

To demonstrate SIGNAL output and applicability, we re-examined a dataset of 113 Canadian samples from November 6-10, 2020 that underwent ARTIC3 PCR (https://github.com/artic-network/primer-schemes) and Illumina paired-end 250 bp sequencing. All sequencing reads are available in BioProject PRJNA689621. All consensus genome sequences and associated metadata in this dataset are published in GISAIDâ€™s EpiCoV database: to view the contributors of each individual sequence with details such as accession number, Virus name, Collection date, Originating Lab and Submitting Lab and the list of Authors, visit DOI:10.55876/gis8.240105tb.
