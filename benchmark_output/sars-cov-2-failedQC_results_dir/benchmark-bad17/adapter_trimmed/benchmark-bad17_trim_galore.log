Path to Cutadapt set as: 'cutadapt' (default)
Cutadapt seems to be working fine (tested command 'cutadapt --version')
Cutadapt version: 4.8
Could not detect version of Python used by Cutadapt from the first line of Cutadapt (but found this: >>>#!/bin/sh<<<)
Letting the (modified) Cutadapt deal with the Python version instead
Parallel gzip (pigz) detected. Proceeding with multicore (de)compression using 2 cores

No quality encoding type selected. Assuming that the data provided uses Sanger encoded Phred scores (default)

Output will be written into the directory: /workspace/lab/mcarthurlab/nasirja/covid-19-signal/benchmark_output/sars-cov-2-failedQC_results_dir/benchmark-bad17/adapter_trimmed/


AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> benchmark-bad17/host_removal/benchmark-bad17_R1.fastq.gz <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
Nextera	0	CTGTCTCTTATA	1270	0.00
Illumina	0	AGATCGGAAGAGC	1270	0.00
smallRNA	0	TGGAATTCTCGG	1270	0.00
Unable to auto-detect most prominent adapter from the first specified file (count Nextera: 0, count Illumina: 0, count smallRNA: 0)
Defaulting to Illumina universal adapter ( AGATCGGAAGAGC ). Specify -a SEQUENCE to avoid this behavior).
